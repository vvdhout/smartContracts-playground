# Smart Contracts - Playground

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile and this repository. 

Here you will find some Smart Contracts projects that I have been working on in order to get a better grasp on Solidity. Currently, I am working through the Blockchain Developer Nanodegree by Udacity and we recently reached the section on Ethereum and Smart Contracts. I really, really enjoy working on this and have the feeling this fits my interests as well as my skillset a bit more than raw blockchain programming. The goal is to become incredibly familiar with the Solidity syntax and everything around smart contract programming (such as using Ganache, web3.js library, working with ABI's, MetaMask, and so forth) and then, shortly, finish the last project and graduate the 1st term of the Nanodegree.

If you are interested in what I have worked on, be sure to check out this repository. It only holds the actual smart contracts as of now (and no web application files or json packages), though that might chance in the near future as I'll pick on of the SC's to build a dApp around. To get a good idea on what level Solidity programming I am on, be sure to check out the latest addition to the repository.

All the best!
